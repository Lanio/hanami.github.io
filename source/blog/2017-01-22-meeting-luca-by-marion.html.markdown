  I am a Software Developer and joined the Hanami core team in late 2016. In this blog post, I want to tell you how I came to be there.

I’ve been wanting to contribute to open source for some time, but as I am a Junior Programmer, it was hard for me to find a project where I could contribute as a beginner. I tried answering easy questions on stackoverflow, but these are usually snatched away within minutes.

## How I Met Luca

I then went to [RubyDay](http://www.rubyday.it/) in November 2016 to give a talk about learning to program using Ruby. I met Luca Guidi, the founder of Hanami, on the eve of the conference at the conference hotel. He gave me some very useful tips for my talk, as he was already experienced with conference talks. He also supported me the next morning before my talk. When the time of my talk arrived, he was sitting in the first row, listening closely. After the talk, he gave me great feedback, saying that he hoped that it is the first talk of many to come. I was very touched.

In the afternoon, I was at his talk about the lessons learned while building Hanami. I liked the talk a lot, because it was about the human side of open source programming. Luca talked about the importance of programmer’s happiness in open source and that the personal life should not be neglected. I learned a lot for my future career as a programmer and open source contributor. I went to congratulate him after his talk, but there was not a lot of time to speak longer.

## Joining Hanami

When I was back home, I got in touch with Luca over Twitter asking him if there was anything I could do for Hanami, because I like his attitude towards open source. We scheduled a call to talk in more detail and he asked me if I would like to join the Hanami core team. This was a big honor for me, so naturally, I said yes. Thereafter, I joined the subteam that is responsible for community work for Hanami and I had a great time spreading the word about Hanami. I've given introductions to Hanami at some local events in Zurich to make people aware that there is a great new Ruby framework. Also, I was in charge of a campaign where we sent Hanami stickers to people who contributed to our guides.

## My Tasks Now

All the time, I was admiring the technical work that my team mates did and I wished that I could contribute in a technical way as well. After some time, Luca encouraged me to do some technical work. We discussed the tasks first, so that it gets clear what the task involves. Luca has always been very patient and took the time to do pair programming whenever something was not quite clear to me. Since then, I've been doing some technical work that includes the Hanami-ujs gem. I am very happy about this and I hope that I can keep contributing to the Hanami codebase in the future.

If you are interested in helping Hanami with open source contribution, you find current issues [here.](https://github.com/hanami/hanami/issues) Any help is greatly appreciated.
